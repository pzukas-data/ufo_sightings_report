# UFO Sightings Analysis Using PowerBI
## About

This report has been created using a dataset from Kaggle.com. The dataset was scraped, geolocated, and time-standardized from NUFORC (The National UFO Reporting Center).

There were several questions I wanted to answer and visualize.

1) In which years were the most sightings observed and when did they significantly increase?
2) Are there any trends over time? Seasonality, time of day, day of the week?
3) What are the most common UFO descriptions?
4) What is the average encounter time?
5) What are the key conclusions?

## Findings

1) Sightings significantly increased from 1994 onwards, with a peak in 2012 possibly due to the end of the Mayan calendar and people's fascination with it.
2) The most active time for sightings appears to be during the summer months and on weekends between 9pm to 10pm.
3) The most common UFO description was overwhelmingly "light."
4) The average encounter time is about 2 hours, which is quite long.
5) If you want to increase your chances of spotting a UFO, you should do it in July, on a Saturday, around 9-10pm and look for lights. Typically, people like to relax and party during this period, which could, in part, explain the increased frequency.

## Limitations

It is important to note that the dataset is limited to sightings from 1910 to 2014.
